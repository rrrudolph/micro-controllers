This is a file for the Arduino IDE. It steps through a range of frequencies, choosing 3 random decimals for each integer. The signal gets sent to an amplifier and then passed to a copper coil to create a pulsating magnet field. It's supposed to help with inflammation and other things, which it did.

I'm currently simplifying the circuit as the amplifier, V5 power source, and relay is not needed.
