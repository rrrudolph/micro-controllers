### PEMF Generator
This is a file for the Arduino IDE. It steps through a range of frequencies, taking 3 random decimals for each integer. The signal gets sent to an amplifier and then passed to a copper coil to create a pulsating magnet field. It's supposed to help with inflammation and other things, which it did.

This video demonstrates the user inputs:
