The PEMF generator is a file for the Arduino IDE. It steps through a range of frequencies, taking 3 random decimals for each integer. The signal gets sent to an amplifier and then passed to a copper coil to create a pulsating magnet field. It's supposed to help with inflammation and other things.

This picture was taken during testing. I used a rumbler (don't remember what they're actually called) to listen to the frequencies but the coil takes its place in the real setup.
